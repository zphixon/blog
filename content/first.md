I only *sort of* want to write a blog, and basically everything I've looked at
has been completely awful. I figured I could write my own, but I remembered

1. I hate web development. Browsers are cursed. Javascript makes me gag (I do
   not count typescript as distinct from javascript)
2. I hardly have the motivation to complete my personal projects beyond the
   bare minimum necessary to give me dopamine
3. In the end, I will have a static site generator I will be using to write a
   blog with
4. Because of all of this, there is endless opportunity for me to fall down a
   hole and never actually write anything

For these reasons I have decided to bend a zola theme to my will. This one
(abridge, the theme, and zola, the static site generator) seem to be ones which
least make me want to never touch a computer again.

I'm sure there's people out there who use these features for actually
interesting things, but all I really want are tags, an index, some overview of
my posts, and maybe search. Nothing really seems to do that, so here we are.

Uhhhh

Maybe more of my future posts will be less obnoxious. It is 11pm and I am
peeved. I apologize. Goodnight.
