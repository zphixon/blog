my name is zack. I live in USDA plant hardiness zone 8a. this user can say it. I
go by he/him (for now ðŸ˜ˆ). I have also gone by afdsadf and cheezgi. I touch
computers for a living.  I'm what the american right might call a "communist
socialist leftist radical liberal" because I think all humans are entitled to
their base physiological needs.

I have a blog [here](/blog), with an atom feed.
